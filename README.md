Somber is a light weight minecraft shaderpack that aims to bring back the atmosphere of earlier versions of minecraft with added eerie effects.

**It is recommended to use the built-in *Programmer Art* texture pack to bring back old textures.**

The shader also accentuates shadows similarly to old versions, adds dynamic fog which darkens with depth, and removes transparency from the top water layers so you can't see what's below.
