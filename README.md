# Somber

https://modrinth.com/shader/somber

Somber is a light weight Iris minecraft shaderpack that aims to bring back the nostalgic atmosphere of earlier versions of minecraft with added eerie effects.

**It is recommended to use the built-in *Programmer Art* texture pack to bring back old textures.**
